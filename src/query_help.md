### Tag Selection

Currently the openHistorian Phasor Datasource only allows the choosing of single phasor points using the picker below.  If you know the appropriate phasor tags and want to enter them manually, then do so in the text editor using a ';' separated list, e.i. "PPA:4; PPA:2".  These tags can be found in the ActivePhasor view in the database.
